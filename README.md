# CSS-Only Sliding Navigation Menu

A lightweight, fully responsive, and animated sliding navigation menu built with pure HTML and CSS.

It cleverly uses the `:checked` pseudo-class (the "checkbox hack") to manage its open/close state, requiring **zero JavaScript**. This makes it extremely fast, performant, and reliable.
